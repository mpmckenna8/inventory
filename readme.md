Another go at creating an inventory app. Maybe this one will be semi functional!

basic walkthrough of tools I'm using:
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-web-app-s3-lambda-api-gateway-dynamodb/?e=gs2020&p=fullstack



tooling:
Looking to use AWS for hosting with github to keep track of lots of my frontend code which probably makes it a lot easier to hack but whatevs. no one uses it but me.

AWS Amplify is connected to my github repo and updates as that updates.


Using API gateway to handle requests from the frontend client.
- Need to make sure looking at the US-west-2 region to find the one I'm using.





Node Tooling:

Trying to use much more modern node version than usual.  Using n to handle node versions. https://github.com/tj/n

To do local hosting using http-server
